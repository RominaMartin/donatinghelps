Hello!

I'm Romina, I made this little project [@codepen](https://codepen.io/RominaMartin/full/OJVdvRm) where you can check the compabilities of the blood types.
It's my first time with a deployed project on my own, it is at [https://donatinghelps.com](https://donatinghelps.com)

Since many people have seeing it now I feel this is my chance to help out in some way. Since I don't consider myself an expert I decided to put this repo out in case anyone wants to help me archieve a nice code and experience for everyone who can eventually use this project.

I'll set two directories for now:

```
/src
    -> pug file
    -> scss file
    -> js file
/dist
    -> compiled html file
    -> compiled css file
    -> js file
```

So please don't hesitate to create pull requests or message me with any ideas. I'm [@rominamartinlib](https://twitter.com/rominamartinlib)
